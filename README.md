# Trampoline Dynamic Programming
Comp 482 - Algorithm Design - Lab 4 - Trampoline Dynamic Programming
## Objective
Use dynamic programming to find the min. hops to jump from rightmost index
to leftmost index. Each trampoline _i_ has a weight _B[i]_.
## Input
- In a file called "input.txt"
- First line is num. of trampolines
- Second line are the weights of each trampoline
## Quick Start
In CLI:
1. javac Project4.java
2. java Project4
